# SafeLogin

A modern, secure user authentication module for Node.js applications.

Overview
SafeLogin is a hackathon project providing robust user authentication tools for web applications. Built with industry best practices in mind, it features secure registration, login, password hashing, session management, and support for OAuth/SSO to help you authenticate users with confidence.

## Features
User Registration & Login
Register and authenticate users securely with Node.js.
Password Hashing (bcrypt)
Protect user credentials using bcrypt for strong password hashing.
Session Management
Manage user sessions with express-session and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for scalable, secure authentication.
OAuth / Single Sign-On (SSO)
Enable easy sign-in via providers like Google, GitHub, etc. using Passport.js or similar strategies.

## Tech Stack
Node.js
Express.js
bcrypt
express-session
jsonwebtoken (JWT)
Passport.js (for OAuth/SSO)
MongoDB (or any preferred user data store)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/xmaemaumeowx/cb_SafeLogin.git
cd cb_SafeLogin 
```

2. Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
3. Set up environment variables
Copy .env.example to .env and fill in secrets for JWT, session, and OAuth providers.

4. Start the server
```
npm run
```
5. Try it out!!!
   
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000

## Folder Structure

  /models      # User models/schemas
  /config      # Passport, JWT, session config
  /controllers # Auth logic
  /views       # Minimal UI (optional)
```

## Security Best Practices

All passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage.
Sessions are securely managed via HTTP-only cookies.
JWTs used for stateless authentication.
OAuth flows securely handle third-party credentials.
